This book is generated using elementary cellular automata with two randomly selected units of text mapped to the binary states of each cell.

The starting automaton is seeded with a randomly selected list of states. This seed is used to generate a wall of textâ€”a study of repetition and contrast which combines the universal pattern generated by the automaton with the particular visual density of the selected units of text.

The number of cells in each generation and the number of generations are dependent on the length of the selected units. For this to work, the selected units must be the exact same length and the output text must be set in a monospace font.
